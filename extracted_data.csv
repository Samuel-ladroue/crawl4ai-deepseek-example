"SE mums need your help to find a good area (Grove Park, Beckenham and surroundings)","Hi, We need to move by the end of the year from our rental in Hither Green, we live on the Catford end so unfortunately we get a lot of petty crime and incidents so we want to move somewhere else. My daughter will go to Bonus Pastor so we are considering the following areas: -Grove Park/Horn Park/Lee -Sundridge Park -New Beckenham/Beckenham Junction We need/want; -An easy not long commute to London Bridge/Cannon Street. -A good state primary school for our 8 yo son. -A safe area, at least safer than Hither Green, I know there is petty crime all over London but in some areas less than others. Would you recommend the areas above? Any streets/specific areas to avoid? We are considering buying a house. Thank you"
At the end of my tether with 6mo - is this normal?,"I have a 6 month old DS who never slept well but has recently taken a turn for the worse beyond even the 4 month sleep regression which lasted 1.5 months for us. We’ve only really had about 2 good weeks of sleep since beginning of the year. I started weaning at 6 months and while that’s going ok, I’ve decided to stop breastfeeding as he just isn’t sleeping more than 2 hours at a time, 2.5/3 at a push and I’m desperate for some help from my husband or family. I’ve introduced formula, and while it says on the tin they need 5 x 210ml a day, he’s chugging through 3 x 210ml plus 5 breastfeeds and 2 meals a day (porridge, veggie pasta, etc) and having at least 3 feeds at night. I can’t understand why he is taking on so much and nothing I do in regards to feeding is making any difference. Is it normal for a 6 month old to need to eat this much? He goes “to bed” at just gone 7, wakes 10, 12, 1 3, at 5am wakes for about half an hour and then wakes for the day at 7. Im absolutely exhausted and feel like I can’t keep this up for much longer - I don’t know if it’s a schedule issue but I can’t settle him in the night without him feeding and he is taking the milk. He settles himself at bedtime and we’ve been working on this. During the day his naps are all over the place in terms of length, they can be 20 mins or 2hrs there’s no consistency so it makes it hard to keep to our set bedtime in terms of wake windows. if anyone has any advice I’d be so grateful as I’m trying to save for a sleep consultant."
Can all of these physical symptoms really be caused by stress and anxiety? I don’t know how to snap out of it,"So back in September I started feeling lightheaded as if a boat was moving or as if the floor dropped beneath my feet, went to the gp a number of times who eventually put it down to it being viral but it’s never gone away since then. Some days I’ll be fine, if I’m happy I’ll forget about it it kind of goes away. I do need glasses and my prescription is 0.50 both eyes I last had them tested in June 2024 and she said I don’t need glasses all the time but when I feel comfortable like I need them, my eyesight has been feeling more blurry and I’ve also found when I permanently wear my glasses the “dizziness” also resolves completely. During all this time I’ve been using my phone for about 8 and a half hours each day googling my symptoms and thinking I’m dying.I’ve been under a lot of stress, always suffered with anxiety but after a 6 year age gap I had another baby. My kids are now 9,7 and 18 months and I am a stay at home mum with no support and my toddler is absolutely killing me. She has never slept through the night, even at 18 months she won’t be put down on the floor or entertain myself so I cook, clean and do everything with her attached to my hip and she is so heavy now and this has been going on since she was 7 months old. I’ve tried"
letting her cry it out but she just doesn’t quit and give up she will continue screaming until she’s red in the face and exhausts herself,"letting her cry it out but she just doesn’t quit and give up she will continue screaming until she’s red in the face and exhausts herself. Husband doesn’t help much and I never get time to switch off and I do all the school runs and care with my children and home care and I’m so so so exhausted. On top of other daily life stresses we have recently gone through a stressful time of buying a new house. I’ve always suffered with some kind of anxiety but since my pregnancy with my 18 month old I’ve felt my health has declined so much, I had such a difficult pregnancy with her which resulted in hyperemis, depression during pregnancy, a difficult birth with a lot of blood loss, suffered with post partum depression to some degree and also it took months and months to get my iron levels up to standard. And now the dizziness that started in September before she turned 1. Doctor did a blood test and my iron levels had come back to a couple of points below average so he considered it now to be normal. Due to all these symptoms of lightheadedness I started having severe panic attacks which I never had before, these have now eased off and are much better than they was before but they were so bad. I’d have them whilst waiting for my children at school and the dizziness feeling I was getting was even worse during these moments. I’d wake up in the middle of the night with these panic attacks for a couple of months, racing heart, tingling feeling, the dizzy feeling being severe during these times. For the last couple of weeks/days though I’ve had other symptoms of numbness in my face and arms and I feel as if one side of my face is dropping so I start panicking more and keep checking in the mirror to see if my face is “normal” I keep getting these sensations at certain places like when I get into bed at night and the school play ground and end up having a panic attack from it. I’m scared I will end up having a stroke or something, I’m worried the dizziness feeling is something nurological. I don’t know anymore. Can stress and anxiety and sleep deprivation really cause all of these symptoms ?"
Lack of eye contact up close 6 months,I’m looking for advice my little boy is 6 months and when up close doesn’t like looking at me from a distance very engaging laughing smiling and when lying down. But when on my knee rarely looks me up close I’m in an anxious state and really beginning to worry about his future has anyone had similar and baby has turned out neurotypical?
5 yr old son tried to kill dh yesterday,"We were walking along a very busy road and ds asked dh for chocolate. Dh said no so ds then tried to push him onto the road. We both then explained to him how dangerous it was and how that would hurt daddy etc. His response was I don't care. He then pushed dh with all his might onto the road again. He then said hahaha I'm going to kill you. This is our daily life what happened yesterday happens alot. He punches his older siblings, breaks stuff. He screams at the top of his voice all the time. I got myself a new plant today and was showing dh and kids it the minute I put it down He ripped it apart. He watched me cry and said hahaha it's dead now. I've asked social work for help 3 times now nothing happens His school are having the same problems. Even with a one to one full time. it's still a struggle for them He can't even eat lunch with the other children because of his violence. The doctor put me one more medication for low mood and anxiety today. So three lots of medication I'm on now. I'm scared for us but I'm really scared what ds will grow up to me. He has been diagnosed with autism and awaiting a adhd assessment ( 3 yr wait)"
One day old baby in pub,"So family member gave birth to first baby yesterday afternoon, she's a very young mum only 17 , normal delivery but episiotomy, baby good weight healthy. Was discharged home today and a couple of hours later was at the local pub not drinking alcohol just showing baby off and eating a meal , but am I right in thinking a day old baby baby is really too young to be in a pub or anywhere really , also worried she should be resting as obviously will be sore. Other family members have said I'm being old fashioned am I."
How to tell if toddler has bladder control?,I want to try potty training with my almost 3 year old as she shows a lot of signs of being ready and already uses the potty sometimes. However I’m not sure if she has sufficient bladder control as her nappy often seems a bit wet even after relatively short times and when she is going to the potty at night she often does several small wees. Is there any way to tell if she us ready without just giving it a go (which we plan to do over Easter)? She does have low muscle tone which can affect bladder control from what I’ve read but not all children are affected in the same way.
"Baby refuses milk, takes water",My baby is 7 months old and I've just returned to work. He's refusing milk out of any bottle or cup. We've tried pumped breast milk and we've tried formula but the only thing
AIBU it’s only fair ds goes?,"have a section of our garden built up and dedicated to that sport. He just teaches our dc and they play there now. Ds has mostly had garden parties and then and on play dates his friends play there also. Mum of one of his friends at a past play date mentioned her ds would love to learn do the sport and do something like this for his birthday but couldn’t find anywhere near. Dh said that he’s welcome to come and practice whenever and actually could have party here if she couldn’t find anywhere else. It was then agreed her ds could have his party in our garden and borrow equipment we had but that obviously over wise party organising is her responsibility. She has other entertainment, food arranged ect, party is quite soon. She’s now said that she doesn’t think my DS should come as she’s worried the fact it’s his house/garden and he is good at the sport will take the shine of her DS and people will think it’s my DS’s day instead. And as it’s an out of school friend he would only know a few of kids anyway. She never specifically said ds was invited we just assumed and we probably agreed based on that assumption. I don’t think its fair to have ds locked in the house or taken out when his friends and boys his age playing in our garden and am shocked she thinks this is an okay suggestion. AIBU it’s only fair ds goes?"
What to buy in French pharmacies,"We are going to France and 14yo dd is most excited about.... nope, none of the sights. She wants to go shopping in French pharmacies. Any tips on what products are cheaper or more exciting in France? (for clarity, it's skincare and cosmetics, not medicines!)"
Holiday inspo for 18 month old,I’m looking to plan a holiday in Apr/May 2026 when my DS with be around 17/18 months old. We’ve looking around Europe - ideally a 2-3 hour flight and a hotel that caters for families with an area or club that will suitable for an 18 month old. Also we would like to do an all inclusive as we just don’t want the hassle of thinking about cooking no and finding places to eat out. Also a hotel room with a separate living and sleep space as we would like to stay up later when he goes to bed. I’ve visited my local TUI and they recommend their TUI Blue range and we like the look of the Menorca one. But just wondering whether anyone could recommend else where. Our budget is around £2k (a little over is fine) for 2 adults and 18-ish month old. thanks mums of mumsnet in advance 😅
Kissed children with potential cold sore,"Hi Really worried I have exposed my children (4 and 16 months) to cold sore virus. What I thought was a strange spot in the middle of my lip popped up at the start of the week but I am now worried it’s a cold sore despite never having one before at the age of 33. I’m not sure how they normally present. It was like a pimple under the surface but I picked at it and it has since scabbed. i definitely have kissed the kids with it, certainly at the beginning of the week before I started to think it might be a cold sore. Are they likely to have caught this virus, my 4 year old has a temperature from yesterday evening and I’m now worried she is coming down with it."

DD friend is a furry/therian. Trying to encourage (strongly) my DD to be the same.,"What would you do in this situation? Child in class is 'recruiting' other children (mainly very quiet children) to be furries. She says she is a therian and presents as a wolf. School has banned her wearing wolf items to school but she still does on party days/world book day/non uniform etc Parents seem to do littke about it Quite older parents. Children are 10. My DD has so far not engaged but likes the child involved but is being pressured. It was her birthday recently and friend bought her a tail 🙄 I think this is completely weird. Child digs holes at lunch time, barks at people etc cute/acceptable up until age 5 or 6 but not girls that are on the cusp of puberty! AIBU? Yes- she's only a kid, will spon grow out of it. No - its weird, school and parents should do more to address it"
When do you pump?!,"Hi everyone, My baby is 4 weeks old and I’m exclusively bottle-feeding her expressed breast milk. Lately, I’ve been finding it really difficult to find time to pump. Does anyone else struggle with this? By the time I’ve fed her, burped her, changed her nappy, and settled her to sleep, I feel like I only have about an hour before it all starts again. People keep telling me to “sleep when the baby sleeps”, but between pumping, cleaning bottles, and trying to keep on top of housework, I don’t really get the chance to rest. It’s starting to feel quite overwhelming. I’d really appreciate any tips or advice on how to better manage this stage — how do you all balance pumping, sleep, and everything else?"
To hate school holidays,It’s just so draining. Dh works full time and needs reminding it’s actually the holidays. Wouldn’t think to take time off unless prompted. Certainly hasn’t got the gumption to come up with
To tell child not to be in any photos without her sister,"I have issues with my in-laws excluding my eldest daughter who is my husband’s stepdaughter from photographs. This upsets my eldest. BiL has two sets of children with the elder ones in their twenties, I saw FiL talking to one of them and the nephew then chatted to the elder siblings and cousins and they then took turns to take photos. When my eldest took the photos instructions were given to her and it is ALWAYS these photos that appear at in-laws so pictures of bio grandchildren without my daughter. On Easter Saturday can I instruct my five year old not to stand in any photos with her cousins without her sister? POLL Am I being unreasonable? 2 days remaining 273"

Sons behaviour,"Ds is 7 and last week I got called over at the end of the day to speak with his teacher about his behaviour which turned into an hour long conversation with her, the Emotional Literacy Support Assistance (ELSA) teacher and headmaster. His behaviour has reached a point where they now want me to make a doctors appointment for him. I asked what they think is going on and all I got was “we wouldn’t like to say”. I’ve waited over a week for a list of their concerns and this is what they have said: * He’s a very clever boy - enjoys maths, science and P.E. His reading is above average for his age. ( I could have fluent conversations with this boy at 18 months old) * He struggles sitting at a desk even for short periods of time and will lose focus easily which then turns into him behaving in a distracting way. * In recent months his behaviour in class has deteriorated - saying inappropriate comments to other children, finding it increasingly difficult to contain himself and makes noises or calls out randomly. * He is noticeably trying to control his peers who tend to give in to his demands. * He finds it difficult to regulate his emotions and can easily become angry or will cry if things aren’t going his way. Phoned the doctors today, system has changed and they’re fully booked until the 28th. Told to phone back tomorrow when appointments for the 29th are released. Haven’t really spoken to anybody about this - wondering if anyone has any inclination as to what these behaviours may indicate?"
10 month old waking every 20 mins at night - no joke,"Our usually amazing sleeper has now starting waking every 15-20mins at night. she sits up and screams until we come in, lie her back down where she drifts back off straight away then repeats… all night. she’s recently started nursery as I’m back to work and does not nap in the day more than 30mins. before this with me she would nap an hour and a half in the morning and the same in the afternoon. So it’s a very sudden and drastic change. I think she’s incredibly overtired and out of routine aswell as teething but I simply cannot cope any longer this way. I’m in tears most nights. I end up just putting her in bed with me but I don’t think that’s helping. she is waking up screaming instantly. she has calpol and teething gel, is fed, nappy checked. I just don’t know what else to do but I am broken"
14 month old scratching and biting,"Hey, was hoping for some advice. i have a beautiful little 14 month old boy. He is amazing. So lovely and a real big personality. He’s doing really well developmentally and started saying lots of words, including his new favourite ‘no’. as he’s started to express himself more, he’s been really starting to hit me a lot but more than that he is constantly scratching me. And it hurts so much. I don’t think I really realised how much until my sister just came over and said how bad all the scratches on my face were. He does it when he’s very excited and giving cuddles and stuff but also when he’s frustrated. I’m constantly using a stern voice and saying ‘no’ when he’s does it and modelling kind hands. He will then stroke my face gently and say ‘aww’ but the behaviour isn’t getting any better. I’ve got at least 10 bloody cuts on my face. I’ve cut his nails but they seem to dig in deep when he scratches. im not sure what else to do. And my face looks awful 😂🤦🏻‍♀️"
Boyfriend doesn’t lift a finger in the house and I’m exhausted,"Currently I stay at home and look after our 3 month old whilst my boyfriend works. Maintaining the house, laundry and cooking are my job and I’m ok with this, pulling my weight is important to me and I’ve always happily done these things in the relationship. However, since our baby was born it’s been SO much harder to keep up with it all and I feel completely burnt out mentally and physically. In the first 2 weeks of my daughter’s life, he cooked for me a few times and helped out with house stuff and I felt so lucky and relieved, but it all abruptly ended after that. I remember then doing the laundry and cleaning whilst the baby slept, trying to keep my legs together as my stitches were hurting and my back was in agony. It was all just immediately down to me again and that was really hard whilst navigating having a new baby and very limited sleep. I accept my role at the moment and am just about ok to balance all actual cleaning, laundry and cooking duties with caring for our newborn, but he doesn’t appreciate what I’m doing and the mess he makes everywhere he goes is ridiculous and sets me back"
Making children do extra curricular activities,"How do you feel about forcing/pushing school into doing extra curricular activities. Ds is 9, soon to be 10. He plays football in a team and does swimming lessons. All fine, that’s plenty. He enjoys the football, but does sometimes complain about going to matches on weekends. He’s not brilliant but certainly not terrible. The football teams are getting much more competitive and selective as he’s getting older. He has the opportunity to join a second team which is very relaxed/just for fun and not too time consuming, and would give him a bit more practise, but he doesn’t want to. His only reason is that he can’t be bothered. He moans like crazy about going to swimming lessons, he’s a very good swimmer, so could potentially stop, but it’s only 30 minutes a week and it’s not like he finds it difficult. We tried tennis but he hated it, we started taking him to parkrun, he’s a really good, fast runner, but he always said he couldn’t be bothered to go. I don’t want to over schedule him, but I do find it a little bit odd that he can’t be bothered to do anything lot of these things. He doesn’t like going out much at all. He doesn’t like school, no particular reason, he just wants to be at home. He only likes going out for a very short time and short distance and always wants to go home."
Teenage ds16 with social anxiety - anyone got any good advice?,"so far ds has said he's social anxious. He was always a happy friendly out going kid so it's taken me by surprise. Says it's been the last few years. My confusion: He doesn't seem to have an interest in helping himself to fix it. I bought a book, hasn't read it. Loads of support at college, doesn't access it. Could get counselling via zoom, no interest. He completely stonewalls any attempts at conversation on the whole. He comes down for dinner and on holiday but otherwise is mainly in his room. Seems quite cheery though and attends college 99%. For a job I basically get shit done. I want to support him but at the same time, I know I can't fix it for him. SO I am kinda stuck. What do I do, if anything? I don't want to leave it and it gets worse! But at the same time....... I know I can't fix it. Anyone a few years down the road and can look back to help ?"
"9 yr old DS, doesn’t let me talk to DH",He constant interrupts and tries to get the attention of one of us. DH and I work full time so we don’t get much time together. DS won’t let me speak to DH for 5 mins! DH doesn’t stop this behaviour - I think he quite enjoys the attn when 2 people are fighting for him. It’s also quite sad that DH doesn’t prioritise talking to me. what should I do? Just stop talking to DH until he stands up for me? POLL Am I being unreasonable? 2 days remaining
